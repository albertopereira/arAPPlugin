# arAPPlugin
__Theme for Atom (Access to Memory)__

This theme is for version 2.5. Previous versions will probably not work.

__Some features__

* By default, Atom permissions allow descriptions to be read in browse lists, sidebar facets, "Popular this week" list. This theme removes any items that a specific user, or user group, doesn't have permissions to read;
* The "Popular this week" box gets a bigger highlight;
* The first element of the "Popular this week" also shows its thumbnail (if it exists);
* Overall style changes (including new icons);

* A Blog! (well, sort of), it uses static pages to mimic a blog. You just have to create a page called "Blog", and any other page that has a title that starts with "_X-", will automatically be listed in the blog page (e.g. "_X-A post title").

* You don't have to chose between the sidebar treeview and the full width treeview. You can have both. There's a new link, right below the sidebar treeview, that opens a popup with the full width treeview.
